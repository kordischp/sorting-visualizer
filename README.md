  <p align="center">
    This project implements a sorting algorithms visualizer using Python's Tkinter for the GUI. It allows users to visualize popular sorting algorithms step-by-step.
</div>

## About The Project
The Sorting Algorithms Visualizer is designed to help users understand how 
different sorting algorithms work by visualizing each step of the sorting process. 
It includes various sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Selection Sort 
or Insertion Sort.

The project uses Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI), 
providing interactive buttons and sliders to control the visualization parameters.

The source code is provided in the repository.

## Usage
The program can be run from the .py file as well as from .exe file (in dist 
directory), which is recommended. After the window pops up, you can maximize it or 
keep it in windowed mode. 

Steps to run the sorting algorithm: 
* Specify the maximum value of the array to be sorted, then click `OK`, a value of 50 and 100 is recommended. Accepts values in range 3-1000 for performance reasons.
* Select the sorting algorithms from the drop-down menu.
* Click `Reversed` to reverse the array or `Random` (can be clicked multiple
times) to randomize the values' positions.
* Optionally - set the delay time (in milliseconds) on the slider to slow down the
animation
* Click `Run` to start the program. It is recommended to click `Reset` to start
 again or stop the program prematurely.
