## About The Project
Explore the fascinating world of sorting algorithms through a dynamic and interactive visual experience. This program allows users to observe and understand how different sorting algorithms operate in real-time.

**Key Features:**

* **Interactive Visualization:** Watch sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, and more, sorting arrays of numbers right before your eyes. Each step of the sorting process is visually represented, offering a clear demonstration of how algorithms rearrange elements.

* **Multiple Algorithms:** Choose from a selection of popular sorting algorithms. Compare their efficiency, understand their mechanics, and witness firsthand how they handle different types of data.

* **Customizable Parameters:** Adjust parameters like array size, speed of visualization, and types of data to see how algorithms perform under different conditions.

* **Educational Insights:** Gain insights into algorithm complexity, runtime performance, and best-case vs. worst-case scenarios. Learn about the trade-offs between different sorting methods and when each algorithm is most suitable.

* **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive controls and an easy to understand interface make it easy for users of all levels to explore and comprehend sorting algorithms.

* **Practical Learning Tool:** Ideal for students, developers, and anyone interested in computer science, offering a hands-on approach to understanding fundamental algorithms used in everyday computing tasks.
